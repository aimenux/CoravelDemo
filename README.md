# CoravelDemo
```
Playing with Coravel library in order to schedule tasks
```

I m using [Worker service template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio#worker-service-template) 
and [Coravel](https://github.com/jamesmh/coravel)
in order to schedule some dummy tasks.

> `Coravel` offer a fluent api in order to schedule synchronous, asynchronous, invocable tasks, etc.
